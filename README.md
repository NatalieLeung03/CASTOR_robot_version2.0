3D printing parts STL files
parts 1-29 in PLA or ABS plastics, part 30 in TPU or elastic material 

parts (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,19,20,21,22,23,24,25) infill is 30% with a wall thickness of 4 passes as seen in Fig. 2. For the remaining parts, the percentage of infill will be 80 to 100% because these parts require high rigidity for proper operation. On the other hand, for the printing of part 30 the use of filaflex material of 700% elongation is required. The printing characteristics for this part depend on the temperature characteristics and conditions of each machine (Recommendation: perform a temperature and calibration test for these elastic materials).
