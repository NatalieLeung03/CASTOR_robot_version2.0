3D printing parts STL files
parts 1-29 in PLA or ABS plastics, part 30 in TPU plastic or filaflex material 

In version 2.0, parts 6,7, 10, 11, 16, 17, 28, 29 are changed. Pieza boca can be 3D printed or laser-cutted for the mouth-piece. 

For parts 1-7,10,11,19-25, the infill is 30% with a wall thickness of 4 passes as seen in Fig. 2. 
For parts 8,9,12-18,26-29, the percentage of infill will be 80 to 100% because these parts require high rigidity for proper operation.\n On the other hand, for the printing of part 30 the use of filaflex material of 700% elongation is required. The printing characteristics for this part depend on the temperature characteristics and conditions of each machine (Recommendation: perform a temperature and calibration test for these elastic materials).
